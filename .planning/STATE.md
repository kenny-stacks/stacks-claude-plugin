## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0: Single-skill MVP validated, progressive disclosure effective
- v1.0: 90% coverage gate with override balances quality/flexibility
- v1.1: Fuzz testing integrated as parallel track in Phase 4 (not separate phase)
- v1.1: Trigger expansion stays Stacks-specific to avoid false positives

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From v1.1 Research:**
- Phase 11: Vitest coverage may not capture Rendezvous execution (separate processes) - needs validation
- Phase 10: Trigger false positive rate needs live testing with Claude Code
- Phase 9: Phase 4 complexity increases with parallel fuzz track - UX clarity critical
